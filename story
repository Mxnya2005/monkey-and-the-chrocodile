once upon a time in a forewst, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a chrocodile and his wife.
The monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using chrocodile skin. He slowly started trying to befriend the chrocodile by feeding him the berries. The berries were delicious and the chrocodile liked them. After sometime the monkey started poisoning the berries.
