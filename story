once upon a time in a forewst, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a chrocodile and his wife.
One day the chrocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The chrocodile came the next day for more fruits as he loved them. As days passed by, the chrocodile and monkey became good friends.
